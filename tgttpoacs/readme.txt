INSTRUCTIONS:

Basically, just point and click your way around. Everything's pretty self-explanatory. Construct simple sentences using the VERBS on the bottom of the screen and the objects surrounding you, and Gert will carry them out. RIGHT-CLICKING on an object automatically EXAMINES it.

If you find that Gert is moving too slowly for your patience, DOUBLE-CLICK at any location on the screen to have her start RUNNING.

Press ESC to SKIP CUTSCENES or bring up the save/load/quit MENU.

Press +/- to change the TEXT SPEED. RIGHT-CLICK when a character is talking to SKIP the speech.

Shortcut keys:
L = QuickLoad
S = QuickSave
E = Examine
P = Pick Up
T = Talk To
M = Smell
U = Use
C = Consume
Q = Quit

Throughout the game, you'll encounter various MINIGAMES. When these come up, you'll be given friendly instructions as to how to play them.

Remember, there are a few branching story paths that you can take in this game that lead to four different endings. Make sure you find them all! And while you're at it, SAVE OFTEN! It'll help, trust me.
