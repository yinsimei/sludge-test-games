# Robin's Rescue
Robin's Rescue is an example point and click adventure game made using the LGPL licenced [SLUDGE engine](http://opensludge.github.io/). This game was made over the course of several days and has a number of rough edges. Wear gloves when handling!

Big thanks to Mim for character designs and animations, and a special thank you to all my Patreon supporters (see SUPPORTERS.md for details).

In this file, you can find:

* Licence information for code, assets and third party assets
* Instructions for playing the game
* Instructions for compiling and/or running the game 
* Notes on how to navigate the game's codebase and resources
* Some helpful/related URLs

I hope you find something useful from playing Robin's Rescue and exploring its code!

## Running The Game
If you are using one of the packaged versions of this game available from the [Robin's Rescue repository](https://github.com/Cheeseness/robins-rescue/releases), double check the following platform specific notes:

### Linux
If you want to run the game without the bundled libraries, be sure to set the SLUDGE_DATADIR environment variable to point to the bin/shaders folder. This environment variable is not a part of vanilla SLUDGE. A diff of source changes can be found in the _sludge_ folder.

If you'd rather run the game with your distro's SLUDGE packages or with a copy of the SLUDGE engine that you've compiled yourself, call the sludge-engine executable with data/robins_rescue.slg as its last argument and it should run swimmingly (ho ho ho).

### Windows
Double click SLUDGEEngine.exe, or drag and drop Gamedata.slg onto SLUDGEEngine.exe.


## Compiling The Game
If you have downloaded [the game's source](https://github.com/Cheeseness/robins-rescue) to compile yourself, you can open _robins_rescue.slu_ in the _SLUDGE Project Manager_ and select _Compile_ from the _Project_ menu to compile the game.

Once compiled, you can select _Run Game_ from the _Project_ menu to start the game.

## Understanding The Source Code
Robin's Rescue has very few code comments (this may change in the future!). Here are some notes to help you navigate the codebase and resources.

### Code Files

* _robins_rescue.slp_ is the SLUDGE project file for the game. It is generated by the _SLUDGE Project Manager_ application and contains details on files that are a part of the project, and game specific settings.
* _init.slu_ includes game initialisation, UI logic code and scene transition code.
* _functions.slu_ includes code for generic functions that aren't implementation specific.
* _inventory.slu_ includes inventory specific rendering and logic code.
* _audio.slu_ includes logic for switching and fading between music tracks as well as variables pointing to audio assets.
* _scenes.slu_ includes functions that represent scenes, containing scene specific configurations (loading backgrounds, floor regions, etc.) as well as hotspots for scene exits.
* _objects.slu_ includes _objectTypes_ that represent in-game objects (interactive and non-interactive). Each object includes a _getDefaultCostume()_ function for accessing a visual representation. objects may also include. _actionuse_ and _actionInventoryUse_ events for handling user interaction logic and addtional events getting inventory specific visual representations.
* _hotspots.slu_ includes _objectTypes_ that represent non-visual regions of interactivity (or regions which are represented by part of a background image). Each object includes an _actionUse_ and/or _actionUseInventory_ event for handling user interaction logic, and most include an _isComplete()_ function for determining whether the puzzle or task it represents is completed.

### Resources

* The _audio_ folder contains all audio (sound effects and music) assets in OGG format.
* The _backgrounds_ folder contains all background images in PNG format, as well as all floor region filed in SLUDGE's FLO format.
* The _sprites_ folder contains all compiled spritesheets in SLUDGE's DUC format.
* The _sprite_sources_ folder contains TGA sources for all sprites and sprite animations. These are not necessary to compile the game.
* The _sludge_ folder contains information on SLUDGE licencing and Linux specific engine code changes for creating portable builds.
